# Grading Scale: check(+) --> excellent codes and analysis
                 check    --> satisfactory (missing small gaps in analysis or codes)
                 check(-) --> unsatisfactory (significant problems with codes/analysis or incomplete)  

Your codes and results look good. The analysis is correct, but you're missing one key element where you're
asked to build on the discussion in the notes to make a quantitative estimate of what the optimal number
of points should be for each algorithm. (I.e., you did the graphical estimate, but not the analytic
one.) 

One other minor nitpick: include the GSL results on the figure and also plot lines using the fitted 
parameters.
Grade: check
