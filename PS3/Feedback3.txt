Grades:  check(-) :  some major problems with the codes and/or analysis
         check    :  good (with some minor gaps in your results/analysis) 
         check(+) :  excellent 
         check(++) : excellent with one of the BONUS problems completed

A few suggestions for the analysis:  

1) Your main difficulty in problem 3 is that you're calling the same HO wavefunction over and
over again (rather than summing over different HO wf's weighted by the respective expansion
coefficient.)

2) Until the above is fixed, it's kind of superflous, but  bit more detail will be needed on the analysis for #3. 
Hint: Physically, what does b control in the HO wf's?
3) b should have no bearing on the normalization of psi(r), see your "factor1" variable. 
 A good way to check this is to actually compute the normalization integral of your constructed
ground state wave function.  

Grade: check(-)   Since the error in point 1 is easy to fix, you can easily bump up to a check or check(+) depending on
the rest of the analysis.
