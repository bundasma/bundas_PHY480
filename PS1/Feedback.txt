# HW grading scale: check(+) --> excellent (good code and analysis) 
#                   check    --> satisfactory (minor shortcomings in code and/or analysis)
#                   check(-) --> significant problems w/code or analysis


1) Problem 1 (area.cpp embellishments): 

* Your code looks good, though 1 minor nitpick is the output to the file is a bit cryptic (i.e., just
a number). Also, it's good practice to close all file streams once you're done with them. 


2)Problem 2 (sum up/down): 

* Your code looks good, though another minor nitpick is your choice of filename. It's always good
to use a name that hints at what the code actually does (e.g., order_of_summation.cpp).
 
* Your figure looks right, though note if you follow the hint on the course webpage (i.e., use
a logarithmic spacing of N rather than doing every case from 1 to 100000), it looks ALOT cleaner. 

* You have the right idea of why the downward sum is better-- it's the 
same mechanism as the example in class where we compared eps+eps+...+eps +1 vs 
1 + eps + eps +...   

3) Problem 3 (bessel functions): 

* Your code looks good, and your plot looks correct.

The analysis is missing a few important points. For instance, at small x and large x, the relative
difference is of order 1. Can you identify which one (if any) is most accurate 
in these regions? Ditto for the region where the relative difference is around machine precision? 

Both for this and the previous problem, you might find the discussion in the Ch. 4 notes
about to be useful. There we discuss how the relative difference 
for 2 approximations is a useful tool even if we don't know the "exact" result. 

Note also that the gsl output could be viewed as the "exact" 
answer (it seems reasonable since it's part of a widely used scientific library!),
and you could compute relative errors of the up/down versions wrt the gsl output to tease
out where the up and down versions are accurate. 
 
##### HW grade = check 

Your codes look pretty good. You generally have the right idea on your analysis, though a few 
points are missing or could be made a bit clearer.
